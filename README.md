#The seq command can be used to generate a list or sequence of numbers. For example, to generate the sequence, 1 2 3 4 5, 
#you would execute the seq 1 5 command. Generally, sequences start with the first number and continue one by one, ending with the last number.
#If a third argument is used with the seq command, then the third value becomes the last number that will be generated by the sequence, 
#and the second value becomes the increment between each number. For example, executing the seq 10 -1 0 
#command would generate the sequence 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0. 
#The sequence still starts at the first number, ends at the third number, and decreases by one each time because the second number has a value of -1.
#Often, it is necessary to have a for statement execute for a series of numbers, so the output of the seq command is often substituted into the 
#for statement to provide these numbers. To perform command substitution, the seq statement is enclosed with backquotes such as `seq 1 5` or with the dollar sign $ 
#and a pair of parentheses, such as $(seq 1 5).
